In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until a piece of ginger sizzles a little when dropped in. Drop in all of the ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes; reduce heat if necessary to prevent ginger from burning. Remove the pan from the heat. Carefully remove the ginger with tongs and discard.

Cook the noodles according to the package instructions and drain.

Toss the noddles thoroughly with the warm oil to coat. Divide among 4 to 6 serving bowls and top with the fried shallots.
